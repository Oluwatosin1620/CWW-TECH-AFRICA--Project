Where I documented my project using Power BI

## Project Overview
This is an analysis and visualization of students' performance using Power BI to discover the factors affecting the performance of students aged 15-18. This project, my first project as a data analyst, showcases my proficiency in data visualization and presentation using MS PowerPoint, which highlights my ability to transform raw data into actionable insights.
